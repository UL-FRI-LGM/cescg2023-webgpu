# WebGPU Examples
A collection of WebGPU examples for the CESCG 2023 conference workshop.

# Building and running
The examples do not need to be built, but some of them require a server
capable of serving static files (WebGL+CORS restrictions). A basic Node.js
implementation is available in `bin/server.js`.
