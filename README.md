# WebGPU Examples
A collection of WebGPU examples for the CESCG 2023 conference workshop.

## You will need

* A browser that supports WebGPU (Chromium Dev or Firefox Nightly)
* Your favorite text editor
    * We will use VSCode
* A server for static content
    * We recommend VSCode extension "Live Server"
    * Alternatively, you can use `bin/server.js` or `bin/server.py`

## Tasks & Reference Implementations

During the four parts of this workshop you're going to solve tasks in order to learn how to use the WebGPU API.
For each part, you'll find the task descriptions as well as the respective reference implementation in its respective folder:
* [Part 1](./Part 1/Task Description.md)
* [Part 2](./Part 2/Task Description.md)
* [Part 3](./Part 3/Task Description.md)
* [Part 4](./Part 4/Task Description.md)

You can also check out the reference implementations in the browser.
Start a server in the project's root directory and navigate to [reference implementations.html](reference-implementations.html).
